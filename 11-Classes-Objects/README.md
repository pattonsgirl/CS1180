# Week 11 - Classes & Objects

- [introduction to objects and classes](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/class-objects)
  - [Oracle Java Tutorials - Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html)
- [encapsulation](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/encapsulation)
  - Encapsulation refers to the bundling of related fields and methods together. This can be used to achieve data hiding.
  - Encapsulation in itself is not data hiding.
- [access modifiers](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/access-modifiers)
  - focus on **public** and **private**
- ["this" keyword](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/this-keyword)
- [constructors](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/constructors)
- [Class Diagrams & UMLs](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-11/1-class-diagrams)
- [static versus instance (non-static) keyword](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/static-keyword)
- [passing objects by reference](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/examples/passing-method-as-argument)
- breaking down a task to a series of classes
  - [trinknet - Chapter 11 Designing Classes](https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava2/chapter11.html)
  - **includes demos of overriding `toString` (11.6) and `equals` (11.7) and `static` vs non-static methods (11.8)**
- packages
  - everything we are doing is with the same package
    - think knows "how to find" the class
  - if you need to get a class from another package, you need to `import` it
  - [importing packages](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/packages-import)

## Week 12 & 13 - Classes cont.

- [Overriding compareTo()](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-10/2-interface-comparable)
  - for a `class`, add `implements Comparable`
  - [more examples](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comparable-interface-in-java-with-examples/)
- [Overriding hashCode](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/part-8/3-similarity-of-objects)
  - See **Approximate Comparison With HashMap**
  - "creates from the object a "hash code", i.e, a number, that tells a bit about the object's content. If two objects have the same hash value, they may be equal. On the other hand, if two objects have different hash values, they are certainly unequal."

# Weeks 13 & 14: Practice with Classes and Objects

- design and code a banking app
