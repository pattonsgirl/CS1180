- [encapsulation](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/encapsulation)
  - Encapsulation refers to the bundling of related fields and methods together. This can be used to achieve data hiding.
  - Encapsulation in itself is not data hiding.
- [access modifiers](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/access-modifiers)
  - focus on **public** and **private**

- packages
  - everything we are doing is with the same package
    - think knows "how to find" the class
  - if you need to get a class from another package, you need to `import` it
