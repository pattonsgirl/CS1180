## Problem: Sum Day

Write a Java program that reads a list of integers from the user until they enter a sentinel value (e.g., -1). If the user enters positive or negative 42, ignore it. Calculate and display the sum of all positive integers and the sum of all negative integers separately. Finally, display the average of the positive and negative integers.

## Examples

```
Enter an integer (-1 to quit): 5
Enter an integer (-1 to quit): -3
Enter an integer (-1 to quit): 42
Enter an integer (-1 to quit): 8
Enter an integer (-1 to quit): -42
Enter an integer (-1 to quit): -6
Enter an integer (-1 to quit): -1

Sum of positive integers: 13
Sum of negative integers: -9
Average of positive integers: 6.5
Average of negative integers: -4.5
```

## Rubric

Code that does not compile will receive 0/5 points.

Partial credit will be considered if non-working parts have comments that reflect your understanding, what is wrong, and what you need to know to fix it.

1. A loop to continuously read integers from the user until the sentinel value is entered.
2. Separate counters and accumulators for positive and negative integers.
3. Conditional statements to determine if an input is positive or negative.
4. Calculate and display the sum and average of the positive and negative integers.
5. Positive and negative 42 is ignored for the sum and average of positive and negative numbers.
