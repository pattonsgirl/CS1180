# Week 08 - Arrays

- [Programiz - Java array w/ examples](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/arrays)

### What is an array

An array of a collection / list of similar types

- A `String` is an array of `char`acters
- As an intro, we will play with arrays of "primitive" data types
  - `int`, `char`, `double`, `byte`, `short`, `float`, `boolean`
- Once declared, the size **or length** of an array in Java is fixed

### Declaring an array

- `double[] data;`

  - creates the array, but does NOT set a size. This array would not yet be usable until a size is declared: `data = new double[4];`

- `double[] data = new double[numElements];`

  - creates the array and sets it to size / length `numElements`

- `double[] data = {2.3, 1.2, 8.9, 4.0}`

  - creates the array and loads each element with a default value.
  - size is set to number of elements listed on declaration

- accessing array elements
- arrayâ€™s length attributes
- array variables are actually addresses of heap locations
- printing out an array
- accessing the last element in an array
- array index out of bounds exceptions

- review of basic String methods
- recommended activity: l33t translator

### Week 10: More on Arrays

- loop processing of arrays (including for each)
- non-static declaration of arrays
- Common array operations (copy, findMin, shuffle, shift, etc.)
- java.util.Arrays
- command line arguments
- var args
- ArrayLists and HashMaps (adding, removing, retrieving and iterating)
